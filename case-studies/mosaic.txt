Software case study: Experian Mosaic
Experian is one of the “Big Three” consumer credit-checking agencies, along with TransUnion and Equifax. It employs 17,000 people in 37 countries and, in 2014, was earning almost 5 billion pounds each year (Experian Global, 2014; Experian, 2018b). As well as credit-checking, Experian provides analytics and marketing services to a wide range of businesses, as well the public sector. They have a large, high security data centre outside of Nottingham, UK, and many more data centres around the world (Robson, 2005; Khan, 2017). They are a ‘partner company’ working with the Government Digital Service (GDS) as part of ‘GOV.UK Verify’, an identity verification system developed for use by government authorities (GDS, 2018).
There have been a few significant controversies surrounding Experian and its handling of data. In 2014 it was reported that Experian’s databases had been involved in 97 ‘breaches of personal information’ (Pagliery, 2014). It was reported in 2013 that Experian had been fooled into selling its data to an identity theft service that sold Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, bank account and credit card data (Krebs, 2013). In 2015 the personal information of 15 million people was exposed after the company was hacked (Thielman, 2015).
Experian is also one of the 30 ‘organisations of interest’ in the Information Commissioner’s Office’s (ICO) investigation into Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, relating to the use of data analytics in political campaigns (ICO, 2018b: 32-34; 42; Hern, 2018).
A significant tool for data analytics in public services is Experian’s Mosaic tool. In this section, we will outline this tool introduce geodemographics, its history, its evolving role within the UK public sector, and the influence of large, data-rich businesses. We will highlight questions relating to public accountability for proprietary software, commercial entities marketing their products into the public sector, subjective understandings reified in code, and the various sources data is gathered from for systems like Mosaic.
Mosaic
Experian’s Mosaic is one of the most prominent geodemographic segmentation systems in use today. Geodemographic segmentation refers to the practise of sorting individuals or households into distinct, multivariate, demographic categories, with primacy given to geography under the rationale that “birds of a feather flock together”. Veteran of UK geodemographics and the developer behind Acorn and Mosaic, Richard Webber, and sociologist Roger Burrows, in their 2018 book, The Predictive Postcode: The Geodemographic Classification of British Society - which argues for the further use of geodemographic methods in social research - give the following definition:
Put simply, geodemographics is a branch of social analysis that recognizes that where you live matters to any understanding of your values, behaviour and choices as a consumer. It uses data from various sources to place each citizen into a category according to the type of neighbourhood in which he or she lives. (Webber & Burrows, 2018: xxii)
At one time or another, Mosaic classifications have existed for at least the following territories (Experian 2007; 2010):
    • Australia
    • Austria
    • Belgium
    • Canada
    • China (Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai)
    • Czech Republic
    • Denmark
    • Finland
    • France
    • Germany
    • Greece
    • Hong Kong
    • Israel
    • Italy
    • Japan
    • New Zealand
    • Norway
    • Republic of Ireland
    • Romania
    • Singapore
    • Spain
    • Sweden
    • Switzerland
    • The Netherlands
    • UK
    • USA

Mosaic divides populations into distinct “Types”, which are combined into thematic “Groups”. The latest UK version of Mosaic contains 15 Groups and 66 Types for segmenting the UK population. Fig. 1 shows a selection of these from Mosaic Public Sector. Fig. 2 shows an example of some of these categorisations mapped onto a suburban area, taken from a business-targeted Mosaic brochure. Experian develops its taxonomy of Groups and Types through the analysis of large amounts of data, in part through the use of cluster analysis (Webber & Burrows, 2018: 42-43; 78-79). We discuss these sources of data further below.
These categorisations - optimised at the level of (in pre-2014 versions of Mosaic) households and (post-2014) individuals - are the backbone of the Mosaic system (Webber & Burrows, 2018: 85). They purportedly allow for more direct marketing to specific demographics of people than earlier techniques, with the shift to optimising at the individual level being a capacity enabled by the rise of ‘big data’ (Ibid.). The phrase “people-based marketing” is one often thrown around in these contexts (Grieves, 2017).
These demographic segmentations are used by Experian’s customers to guide marketing, distribution, development, and all manner of other business decisions. For example, a company selling private, premium end-of-life care within a certain geographic area might seek to use Mosaic to identify the addresses of all households or individuals under the Type Diamond Days - described by Mosaic as “Retired residents in sizeable homes whose finances are secured by significant assets and generous pensions” - and market directly to them. Or perhaps a budget food retailer seeking to open a store in a new city could use Mosaic to identify areas in the city with the highest concentration of Types under the Group Municipal Challenge and use that information to choose an optimum location for their store, perhaps using a map similar to that in Fig. 2.
Mosaic Public Sector is marketed as providing 'a pin-sharp picture of the people you need to reach, reflecting the latest socioeconomic trends', using 'the latest analytics techniques' to condense 'over 850 million pieces of information across 450 different data points … to identify 15 summary groups and 66 detailed types that are easy to interpret and understand' (Experian, 2016: 2). Experian call Mosaic Public Sector their 'most comprehensive cross-channel segmentation, built for today’s hyper-connected world' (Ibid.). 
Whilst Mosaic is widely used within the UK public sector, it is primarily a tool of ‘commercial sociology’ (Burrows & Gane, 2006). Beyond differences in marketing and customer support, it is unclear if there are any meaningful differences today between the public sector and commercial facing versions of Mosaic in terms of the raw functioning of the classifications and their accompanying visualisations and dashboards. Experian’s commercial facing marketing materials for Mosaic state, 'Behind every customer is an individual. Mosaic means you can start treating them that way' (Experian, 2018a: 2). In their leaflet for Mosaic Public Sector they claim, 'Each citizen is an individual. Mosaic Public Sector enables you to treat them in that way' (Experian, 2016: 2).
In the 2003 version of Mosaic, demographic labels differed between the business and public sector marketed versions, to be ‘more acceptable to those working in the public sector’ (Webber & Burrows, 2018: 113). For example, Metro Multiculture became High density social housing, mostly in inner London, with high levels of diversity, and Welfare Borderline became People living in social housing with uncertain employment in deprived areas (Ibid.). As of the 2014 version of Mosaic, ‘although different versions are marketed to the two user groups, the Group and Type labels are now the same for both’ (Ibid.: 121). Groups are ordered differently in the latest brochures for the commercial and public sector versions of Mosaic, but beyond that there appears to be little divergence (Experian, 2016; 2018). A housing activist we interviewed for this project, speaking of the uses of Mosaic by the private developer Lendlease who were working with their local authority, said
It’s really stigmatising and it ignores so much else that’s going on, so much internal difference, so much shading off. ... That’s a big part of how private developers see the world, so the idea that the owners are in one place and the tenants are in another place, that the owners have a collective personality and the tenants have a collective personality and that’s what we’re seeing here with Experian. ... [The developers are presented with] 66 different [Mosaic] household groups ... you’re presented with a picture of usually a man and a woman and “this is what these people look like, this is where they live, here’s what their tastes are”. So the whole population of an area is reduced down to one couple, which is really bad.
The apparent lack of difference in baseline functionality between the commercial and public sector versions of Mosaic highlights the issue of privately developed software, produced for commercial means, being placed into public sector contexts. This is a recurring theme throughout this project - either with companies remarketing their products produced for the commercial market for the public sector, or public sector organisations purchasing and deploying solutions developed for the market.
Having covered the basics of Mosaic, we will now explore a little of the history and methodological concerns behind Mosaic and geodemographics more generally.
Geodemographics
Geodemographics can be traced back to Victorian social reformer Charles Booth’s 1899 ‘Poverty Map of London’ which used reports of school board visitors as its primary source of data, combined with census data, and Booth personally inspecting neighbourhoods (Webber & Burrows, 2018: 32). The pioneering of computer-based geodemographic systems is generally attributed to Jonathan Robbin who, after serving as a faculty member of the Department of Sociology at New York University in the 1960s, left the academy to apply his methods in other areas. His work was to become the first modern geodemographic system, PRIZM (Potential Rating Index for ZIP Markets). Initially the development of this system was funded by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development to target housing grants to cities with a history of rioting but was later bought up for commercial use (Burrows & Gane, 2006: 43-44).
This trajectory from the public sector to private enterprise - and, as this project is concerned, back to the public sector - is echoed in the UK. Around the same time, working for the Centre for Environmental Studies - a partially government funded thinktank which closed in the 80s - Richard Webber developed the ‘Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods’ (CRN), the first geodemographic classification of the entire UK, which had a resolution at the level of electoral wards (Webber & Burrows, 2018: 48; 73). In 1979 Webber was recruited by CACI, a US consulting organisation, to enhance the resolution of CRN down to the level of the ‘enumeration districts’ used by the census. This system was rebranded as ‘Acorn’ (A Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods) and a descendent of this system is still in active use today, including by local authorities we encountered during our research. Later, Webber went on to found Experian’s micromarketing division, out of which came Mosaic (McElhatton, 2004; Webber & Burrows, 2018: 78). The Royal Mail had launched the UK postcode system in 1974 and Mosaic took advantage of this, offering a finer resolution than the contemporary iterations of CRN and Acorn. Mosaic was also the first UK geodemographic system to incorporate non-census data sources. These sources initially included transactional data sources such as county court judgements, property values, property sales information, ‘electors with names from different ethno-cultural backgrounds’ (Webber & Burrows, 2018: 78).
In their book, Webber and Burrows use Mosaic as their go to example of geodemographic software. They define geodemographics as,
a branch of social analysis that recognizes that where you live matters to any understanding of your values, behaviour and choices as a consumer. It uses data from various sources to place each citizen into a category according to the type of neighbourhood in which he or she lives. (Webber & Burrows, 2018: xxii)
They are keen to distinguish geodemographics from other forms of social analysis that may categorise people 'on the basis of their own personal characteristics, such as age, gender, ethnicity and so on' (Ibid.: 8);
In terms of statistical methods, the feature that distinguishes a geodemographic profile is that it uses what are referred to as multivariate categories. Demographic categories are multivariate in that the set of variables used to construct them typically represents different dimensions of social character. (Ibid.)
Through the lense of this method, geography and locality are given primacy. To paraphrase the epigraph Webber & Burrows choose to open the first chapter of their book, 'birds of a feather flock together'. Whilst remaining critical of sociology’s focus on ‘personal characteristics’ they do stop short of calling for the abandonment of their use (Webber & Burrows, 2018: xxiii).
Webber & Burrows make the argument that geodemographics - and, by implicit extension, Mosaic, their go to example - can be fruitfully deployed in the public sector and for non-commercial social research:
Marketers have long known that such classifications are extremely useful for understanding variations in purchasing habits, tastes, values and so on. We argue that policy-makers, academic social scientists and market researchers are among a number of groups who could similarly benefit from a more extensive engagement with geodemographic modes of analysis. (Webber & Burrows, 2018: xxii)
A controversial supporting point they come back to a few times in their presentation of geodemographics and critique of contemporary social sciences is their view that, referring to approaches which focus on ‘personal characteristics’,
such practices lie at the very heart of the failure of the social sciences to provide credible interpretations of the tectonic socio-cultural divisions that now mark post-Brexit Britain and Trump’s America. (Webber & Burrows, 2018: xxvii)
Their central claim here is that ‘commercial’ social science is in some way ahead of more mainstreamed forms of social research and that separation between the two should be broken down. This, in their minds, means the wider adoption of geodemographic methods by the public sector and academic researchers.
In the public sector, our research suggests this is the trend at the local level, although we cannot speak to how far this will go nor are we able to produce a fully comprehensive view of the current use of geodemographic methods in the UK public sector. Webber and Burrows, it is worth noting, highlight a discrepancy between local and central government. They claim central government still appears resistant to the use of geodemographics, whilst local government has appeared more receptive (Webber & Burrows, 2018: 59; 273).
Public sector use
When deployed in the public sector, Mosaic is often used in conjunction with data already available to public authorities. For example, Kent County Council’s Kent Integrated Dataset (KID) uses Mosaic (as well as CACI’s Acorn) alongside data accessible by the local authority, to attempt to identify trends and provide insights relating to service usage and provision needs. For example, the KID has been used to attempt to predict how likely individuals are to be unnecessarily admitted to hospital within a year. Its linked data has also been used to attempt to identify GP practises in east Kent that may be over-spending, by combining data on the care costs of individuals using those practises (Kent County Council, 2018a; Abi-Aad, 2016). In response to a Freedom of Information request, Kent County Council described Mosaic as a “socio-political profiling tool” (Kent County Council, 2018b). It is still unclear the exact manner in which Kent CC are using Mosaic and similar tools, but it appears their analysis of their own datasets is augmented or based upon Mosaic’s demographic categories. A presentation given by Experian employees in 2014 refers to Mosaic’s ability to allow bespoke classifications, built on top of Mosaic’s basic Types and Groups (Cresswell et al., 2014: 27).
Webber & Burrows note Experian’s efforts to enter the public sector at the turn of the century and the corresponding spread of geodemographics within the public sector in subsequent years:
[T]he public sector was to become the focus of a concerted Experian push during the early 2000s - local authorities, police forces, hospital trusts and fire and emergency services being their primary targets. By 2006 as many as 100 public sector organizations were attending annual conferences focused exclusively on public sector applications of geodemographic classification. (Webber & Burrows, 2018: 80-82)
They note the variety of government authorities attending these early conferences and some of the use cases discussed:
The programmes included speakers such as the Director of Transformational Government at the Cabinet Office and the Head of Customer Insight at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HRMC). Attendees could choose between parallel sessions devoted to the applications of geodemographics to health, local government, community safety and education. Other speakers focused on its application to communications campaigns: Nottingham Primary Care Trust, for example, on smoking cessation; Sports England on increasing participation in active sports; and Thames Valley Police on road safety. A key focus of many of the presentations was how to adapt service delivery to reflect the different communication channels that people living in particular geodemographic categories preferred to use. (Ibid.: 82)
Another contemporary example of the use of Mosaic by UK comes from the London Fire Brigade (LFB). Their ‘incident risk analysis toolkit’ (iRAT) is a collection of statistical analysis techniques that the LFB uses to attempt to identify households in London at risk of fire and which may benefit from intervention. LFB took the data at their disposal on historical fires and overlaid it with Mosaic’s groups within London’s boroughs. By cross-referencing demographic categorisations with data on previous fires, LFB attempted to identify the sorts of people who are more likely to suffer from a fire, with a resolution down to the size of electoral wards. These insights were then used to produce a map of areas seemingly with a higher risk of fire, even for where a fire had not previously occurred, based off of correlation with Mosaic’s classifications. The top three Mosaic demographics highlighted appear to have been those, under the 2006 version of Mosaic’s groups, Twilight Subsistence, Welfare Borderline, and Grey Perspectives (Local Government Improvement and Development, 2010; Experian, 2006). Around 630,000 homes were determined to be within ‘priority postcodes’, down from the 3.5 million homes that make up London (Local Government Improvement and Development, 2010: 6).
In 2016, Lancashire County Council used the 2016 version of Mosaic to produce an analysis of the demographics within its county (Lancashire County Council, 2016). They published corresponding visualisations, using Power BI, a business intelligence tool by Microsoft (Lancashire County Council, 2017). This provides some good examples of the sorts of more raw insights a local authority may attempt to glean from Mosaic. For example, 
Of the 15 mosaic summary groups, 'transient renters', 'senior security' and 'aspiring homemakers' are the most over-represented in the Lancashire-14 area. The areas with transient renters are mainly small, but densely populated, postcodes within central Blackpool, Morecambe and Preston. (Lancashire County Council 2016)
Data
The question of what data - and from where - Mosaic uses is an important one. Due to the proprietary nature of Mosaic, however, it is a difficult one to answer completely. Experian claim Mosaic uses ‘over 850 million pieces of information across 450 different data points’ to produce their demographic categorisations (Experian, 2016: 2). As noted above, census data still plays a prominent role. A presentation by Experian employees in 2014 claimed 28% of the data used at the time to build Mosaic UK was based on census data (Cresswell et al., 2014: 10). However, one of the selling points of a system like Mosaic is its use of more contemporary data than that of census, given that ten or more years can pass between UK censuses. Fig. 3 and 4 show the further sources of information listed in the same 2014 presentation.
It appears Experian’s ConsumerView is utilised by Mosaic, being paired up with higher-level, geography related data. Experian claim,
ConsumerView provides a single, definitive and consistent view of the UK adult population including contact information across postal, email, mobile and display channels, linking to a broad and accurate range of demographic, socio-economic and behavioural characteristics on each adult and household in the UK. (Experian, 2017: 1)
Experian claim to have information on 49 million adults (Ibid.). According to the census, the UK population was 63,182,000 in 2011 (ONS, 2012: 2). Experian claim to have data on 25 million households, 30 million email addresses, 19 million mobile phone numbers, and 10 million landline numbers (Experian, 2017: 2). Furthermore, they write, after quoting these numbers: ‘Online display advertising and our match rates across Facebook (50%) and Twitter (35%) mean you can have a richer view of individuals across every channel’ (Ibid.).
It appears Experian use a mixture of open data, data-scraping, and agreements with third parties to gain access to new data. However, a comprehensive, public record of the data they use is not available, given Experian’s commercial status that means this information is proprietary.  
A noteworthy source of data briefly mentioned is Emma’s Diary - who trade as Lifecycle Marketing (Mother and Baby) Ltd. - used for data relating to children (Cresswell et al., 2014: 8). Emma’s Diary is a website which provides advice and information to parents. As part of the Information Commissioner’s Office’s 2018 investigation into the use of data analytics in political campaigns - in the wake of the controversy surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica (The Guardian, 2018-) - the ICO has issued Emma’s Diary with a £140,000 fine under the Data Protection Act 1998 because of a ‘serious contravention of the first data protection principle’ relating to the fair and lawful processing of data. The ICO claim that Emma’s Diary did not sufficiently notify their users of how their data would be used, with this particular case coming to light because the UK Labour Party, during the investigation, told the ICO that they had been sold data from Emma’s Diary. The Labour Party gained access to this data via Experian, so it would appear to be the same data hitherto mentioned in the Mosaic presentation (Kelion, 2018; ICO, 2018a: 24; 2018c: 9).
We only know a limited amount about the data used by Mosaic, nevermind the intricacies of the analytical methods applied to that data, and the further discretion applied during the “art” (Webber & Burrows, 2018: 85; 131) of geodemographics, used to arrive at Mosaic’s classifications. Knowledge of these sources and methods is the intellectual property of Experian. A housing activist we interviewed for this project claimed this was a barrier to their work, with residents unable to interrogate the data behind a planned development because they were the property of the developer, Lendlease, and Experian, via Mosaic.
